# Implementing Salted Hashing in Code 🧑‍💻

Now, let’s get our hands dirty and implement salting and hashing in code! We’ll use Python for this example.

## Requirements:
- Python 3.x
- `bcrypt` library

To install `bcrypt`, use the following command:
pip install bcrypt







**Next Steps:**
- Experiment with different hashing libraries (e.g., Argon2, PBKDF2)
- Learn how to store and retrieve these hashes securely in a database.
